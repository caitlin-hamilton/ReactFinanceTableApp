Front End Engineer Technical Assessment
Specification
Build a single page application that represents a table of financial instruments.
The table should have the following capabilities:
 Sorting
o by “Asset Class”: Equities first, then Macro and Credit last.
o by “Price” in descending order
o by “Ticker” in alphabetical order
 Presentation
o Rows to be colour-coded by “Asset Class”:
o Macro = White
o Equities = Blue
o Credit = Green
o “Price” should be in blue if positive and red if negative
You may assume an API exists which presents financial instrument data in the following JSON-encoded format:
[
{
"ticker": "ALPHA",
"price": 3150.67,
"assetClass": "Credit"
},
{
"ticker": "BETA",
"price": 3791.37,
"assetClass": "Equities"
}
]
A longer set of sample data is included in a separate file with this document.
For the purposes of this assessment, you can use a client-side function to present API data to your app.
You should utilize react to do the exercise – the preference is to use typescript for the language, but ES5/6 are equally acceptable.
Please write the table component yourself rather than using an off the shelf component.
Assessment
We will review the application together at interview, with focus on the following key topics:
 Adherence to specification
 Stability
 Testing
 Code quality
Please submit your assessment as a GitHub repository with a readme file explaining how to run your application.
